This questionnaire is designed to gather key information about on-premises applications. It helps in understanding the current environment, identifying risks, and planning for cloud migration, modernization, compliance, or disaster recovery.
1. General Information
•	What is the application name and business purpose?
•	Who owns this application (business & technical owner)?
•	What teams use it most?
2. Infrastructure Details
•	On what servers/VMs does it run (OS, version, hardware specs)?
•	Is it physical, VM, or running on a hypervisor (VMware, Hyper-V, etc.)?
•	What database does it use (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc.)?
•	How much CPU, memory, and storage are currently allocated?
3. Application Architecture
•	Is it monolithic or microservices-based?
•	Which programming languages/frameworks are used?
•	Does it depend on middleware (e.g., WebSphere, Tomcat, IIS)?
•	Any APIs exposed/consumed?
4. Dependencies
•	What other applications or systems does it integrate with?
•	Are there batch jobs, schedulers, or ETL pipelines?
•	Does it rely on shared storage, NAS, or SAN?
5. Security & Compliance
•	How is authentication handled (AD, LDAP, SSO, custom)?
•	Are patches and updates applied regularly?
•	What compliance standards apply (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, etc.)?
•	Who has admin access to the servers?
6. Backup & DR
•	How is the application backed up? Frequency?
•	Is there a disaster recovery plan? Recovery Point Objective (RPO) & Recovery Time Objective (RTO)?
•	Are there secondary sites or failover mechanisms?
7. Monitoring & Logging
•	What monitoring tools are in place (Nagios, Zabbix, Datadog, etc.)?
•	Is logging centralized (Splunk, ELK, CloudWatch-like tool)?
•	How are incidents reported and resolved?
8. Performance & Scalability
•	What is the average and peak load (users, transactions)?
•	Can the app scale horizontally (add more servers) or only vertically (bigger servers)?
•	Any known performance bottlenecks?
9. Licensing & Cost
•	Does the app require commercial licenses (Oracle, Windows Server, etc.)?
•	What is the current annual cost of running it on-prem?
10. Future Planning
•	Is the app planned for cloud migration, containerization, or retirement?
•	What improvements are desired by stakeholders?
